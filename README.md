# rosNodes
  This scripts are part of a practice to being started on the ROS nodes topic. Practice with three "flavors" of nodes and arduino comunication. All documentation has been taken from ROS web page and can be found there.  Strongly recomend install Arduino first and the arduino ros serial node to work with it.
